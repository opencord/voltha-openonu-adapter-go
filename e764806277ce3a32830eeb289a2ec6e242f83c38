It would realize some filtering on the MC stream VLAN\u0027s in downstream (if so supported by the ONU). But in my point of view the downstream MC flow can be trusted and moreover if wanted MC streams can be further filtered (on VID and IP) on the UNI interface based on some set IGMP processing.\nSo I think it does no harm here, but it is also not needed.\nCompare also G988 fig. 8.2.2-10: VTFD not natively mentioned here.",
