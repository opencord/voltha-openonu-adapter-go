# Notes on Performance metrics module in openonu-go adapter
Openonu-go adapter supports performance metrics configuration and collection from the ONUs.
There are two types of performance metrics
- Group metrics
- Standalone metrics

The group metrics are managed as a group, meaning we can only set sampling frequency, disable/enable group as a whole and not individual metrics within the group. While in contrast the standalone metrics can be managed individually.

The performance metrics configuration is carried out via the [PmConfigs](https://github.com/opencord/voltha-protos/blob/v4.0.11/protos/voltha_protos/device.proto#L61) protobuf messages.

The meaning of various information elements in the `PmConfigs` and its default value (if applicable) for openonu-go adapter is documented in the below table.

| Key      | Meaning                  | Default for openonu-go | Additional notes|
| :------: | :----------------------- | :--------------------- | :---------|
| id       | onu device id | onu device id|
| default_freq| Default sampling rate| 15 * 60 seconds | Applicable only when `freq_override` is set to false |
| grouped| Forces group names and group semantics| True | When this is set to true, it forces group names and group semantics. This is a `READ ONLY` attribute and cannot be changed from NBI|
|freq_override | Allows Pm to set an individual sample frequency | True| When this is set to true, the group specific sampling rate comes into effect. This is a `READ ONLY` attribute and cannot be changed from NBI|
| groups| The groups if grouped is true| | More details about the groups supported by openonu-go adapter is documented further in this notes.|
|metrics| The metrics themselves if grouped is false.| | Unsupported at the moment|
| max_skew| How long the next sampling is skewed| 0 | openonu-go adapter metrics collection does not skew metric collection |

## Group Metrics

The following group metrics are supported by openonu-go adapter.

### _OpticalPower_
```
// OpticalPowerGroupMetrics are supported optical pm names
var OpticalPowerGroupMetrics = map[string]voltha.PmConfig_PmType{
	"ani_g_instance_id":  voltha.PmConfig_CONTEXT,
	"transmit_power_dBm": voltha.PmConfig_GAUGE,
	"receive_power_dBm":  voltha.PmConfig_GAUGE,
}
```

### _UniStatus_
```
// UniStatusGroupMetrics are supported UNI status names
var UniStatusGroupMetrics = map[string]voltha.PmConfig_PmType{
	"uni_port_no":     voltha.PmConfig_CONTEXT,
	"me_class_id":     voltha.PmConfig_CONTEXT,
	"entity_id":       voltha.PmConfig_CONTEXT,
	"configuration_ind":     voltha.PmConfig_GAUGE,
	"oper_status":     voltha.PmConfig_GAUGE,
	"uni_admin_state": voltha.PmConfig_GAUGE,
}
```
Note:
1. UniStatusMetrics comprise metrics for either PPTP or VEIP ME's and the UNI-G ME.
2. me_class_id defines the corresponding metric type with the ME class value as defined in G988, Table 12.2.4-1
3. `configuration_ind` is relevant only for PPTP ME (meaning me_class_id = 11) and per G.988 specification, "When a circuit pack is present, this attribute represents its type as one of the values from Table 9.1.5-1."
4. Valid values for `oper_state` are 0 (enabled) and 1 (disabled)
5. Valid values for `uni_admin_state` are 0 (unlocks) and 1 (locks)
6. `oper_state` and `uni_admin_state` are relevant for both PPTP (me_class_id = 11) and VEIP ME (me_class_id = 329), however only `uni_admin_state` is relevant for UNI-G ME (me_class_id = 264).

## Basic KPI Format (**KpiEvent2**)

The KPI information is published on the kafka bus under the _voltha.events_ topic. For
VOLTHA PM information, the kafka key is empty and the value is a JSON message composed
of the following key-value pairs.

| key        | value  | Notes |
| :--------: | :----- | :---- |
| type       | string | "slice" or "ts". A "slice" is a set of path/metric data for the same time-stamp. A "ts" is a time-series: array of data for same metric |
| ts         | float  | UTC time-stamp of when the KpiEvent2 was created (seconds since the epoch of January 1, 1970) |
| slice_data | list   | One or more sets of metrics composed of a _metadata_ section and a _metrics_ section. |

**NOTE**: Time-series metrics and corresponding protobuf messages have not been defined.

## Slice Data Format

For KPI slice KPI messages, the _slice_data_ portion of the **KpiEvent2** is composed of a _metadata_ section and a _metrics_ section.

### _metadata_ Section Format

The metadata section is used to:
 - Define which metric/metric-group is being reported (The _title_ field)
 - Provide some common fields required by all metrics (_title_, _timestamp_, _device ID_, ...)
 - Provide metric/metric-group specific context (the _context_ fields)

| key        | value  | Notes |
| :--------: | :----- | :---- |
| title       | string | "slice" or "ts". A "slice" is a set of path/metric data for the same time-stamp. A "ts" is a time-series: array of data for same metric |
| ts         | float | UTC time-stamp of data at the time of collection (seconds since the epoch of January 1, 1970) |
| logical_device_id | string | The logical ID that the device belongs to. This is equivalent to the DPID reported in ONOS for the VOLTHA logical device with the 'of:' prefix removed. |
| device_id | string | The physical device ID that is reporting the metric. |
| serial_number | string | The reported serial number for the physical device reporting the metric. |
| context | map | A key-value map of metric/metric-group specific information.|

The context map is composed of key-value pairs where the key (string) is the label for the context
specific value and the value (string) is the corresponding context value. While most values may be
better represented as a float/integer, there may be some that are better represented as text. For
this reason, values are always represented as strings to allow the ProtoBuf message format to be
as simple as possible.

Here is an JSON _example_ of a current KPI published on the kafka bus under the
_voltha.events_ topic.

```json
   "kpiEvent2":{
      "type":"slice",
      "ts":1611605902528748000,
      "sliceData":[
         {
            "metadata":{
               "title":"OpticalPower",
               "ts":1611605902515836000,
               "logicalDeviceId":"1eda0422-f1cc-42e6-9a23-08039e7cdf43",
               "serialNo":"ALPHe3d1cf70",
               "deviceId":"1eda0422-f1cc-42e6-9a23-08039e7cdf43",
               "context":{
                  "devicetype":"brcm_openomci_onu",
                  "intfID":"0",
                  "onuID":"1"
               },
               "uuid":""
            },
            "metrics":{
               "ani_g_instance_id":32769,
               "receive_power_dBm":1.2,
               "transmit_power_dBm":-16.7
            }
         }
      ]
   }

```

## Useful _voltctl_ commands to manage Performance Metrics

### Get PM config
```
voltctl device pmconfig get <onu-device-id>
```

### List metric groups for a device
```
voltctl device pmconfig group list <onu-device-id>
```

### List metrics within a group

```
voltctl device pmconfig groupmetric list <onu-device-id> <group-name>
```

### Set default sampling rate

```
 voltctl device pmconfig frequency set <onu-device-id> <sampling-rate>
```
Note1: Sampling rate unit is in seconds

Note2: default sample rate is applicable only if frequency override is false

Note3 : The `frequency` has to be greater than 0 and a multiple of _FrequencyGranularity_ which is currently set to 5.

### Disable a group metric

```
voltctl device pmconfig group disable <onu-device-id> <group-name>
```

### Enable a group metric

```
voltctl device pmconfig group enable <onu-device-id> <group-name>
```

### Set group frequency

```
voltctl device pmconfig group set <onu-device-id> <group-name> <frequency>
```
Note1 : The `frequency` has to be greater than 0 and a multiple of _FrequencyGranularity_ which is currently set to 5.

Note2 : The `frequency` of L2 PM counters is fixed at 15m and cannot be changed.

### Listen for KPI events on kafka

```
voltctl -k <kafka-ip:port> event listen --show-body -t 10000 -o json -F
```
Note: For more `event listen` options, check `voltctl event listen --help` command.

## On Demand Counters
voltha supports following on demand counters:
- Ethernet frame extended PM
- Onu Pon Interface stats

### _Ethernet frame extended pm_
Ethernet frame extended pm me collects PM data at a point where an Ethernet flow can be observed.Currently, only
Physical path termination point Ethernet UNI and Virtual Ethernet interface point ME are supported as parent ME.
The protobuf message [protomessage](https://github.com/opencord/voltha-protos/blob/master/protos/voltha_protos/extensions.proto#L259)
reports the pm with below counters for each direction(upstream as well as downstream):

```
uint64 drop_events
uint64 octets
uint64 frames
uint64 broadcast_frames
uint64 multicast_frames
uint64 crc_errored_frames
uint64 undersize_frames
uint64 oversize_frames
uint64 frames_64_octets
uint64 frames_65_to_127_octets
uint64 frames_128_to_255_octets
uint64 frames_256_to_511_octets
uint64 frames_512_to_1023_octets
uint64 frames_1024_to_1518_octets
```
Note :For the fields which are not supported by onu, the counter value is equivalent to either
2^32 -2 for 32 bit Me or 2^64 - 2 for 64bit Me.
### _Onu Pon Interface stats_
Onu Pon interface stats are collected from olt. The protobuf message [protomessage](https://github.com/opencord/voltha-protos/blob/master/protos/voltha_protos/extensions.proto#L157) reports the ith pon interface stats on demand.

Note : The fields in onu stats are optional as the some counters may or may not be supported
by some vendors.

### Useful voltcl commands to fetch on demand stats

#### Get Ethernet frame extended pm

```
voltctl device getextval ethernet_frame_extended_pm <onu-device-id>
```
#### Get Onu stats

```
voltctl device getextval onu_stats <pon-interface-id> <onu-id>
```
Note : The pon interface id and onu id are of type uint32. Hence the input should be respective
pon interface id and onu id in an integer.

## ANI-G Test report

Use below command to pull the report from ANI-G self test command

```
voltctl device getextval onu_pon_optical_info <onu-device-id>
```

Below is sample output.

```
  POWER_FEED_VOLTAGE__VOLTS:      3.26
  RECEIVED_OPTICAL_POWER__dBm:    -16.02
  MEAN_OPTICAL_LAUNCH_POWER__dBm: 5.5660005
  LASER_BIAS_CURRENT__mA:         0.01648
  TEMPERATURE__Celsius:           59.5
```

## Future work
The following Metrics could be supported in the future.

- EthernetBridgeHistory and EthernetUniHistory counters on demand
- xgPON_TC_History
- xgPON_Downstream_History
- xgPON_Upstream_History
