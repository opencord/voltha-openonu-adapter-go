# MIB Templates

## Important Note:

Currently this Git-path contains only a manually adapted version of a MIB template file for BBSIM-ONUs generated by Python openonu-adapter. The original file can be found at:

"https://github.com/opencord/voltha-openonu-adapter/blob/master/templates/BBSM-12345123451234512345-00000000000001-v1.json"

The adaptation was necessary because key-names of meAttributes in this file do not correspond with names used in omci-lib-go
(snake_case- vs UpperCamelCase-notation). This file was created to be able to test MIB template handling with the Go-version
of openonu-adapter even before JIRA https://jira.opencord.org/browse/VOL-3051 is done.
After completion of VOL-3051, automatically generated MIB template files should be stored in this Git-path.

### Note:
To enable co-existence of MIB templates used for the Python- as well as templates used for the Go-version of openonu-adapter,
etcd-storage pathes for both versions will be different:

Python-version:   service/voltha/omci_mibs/templates    (as already in use)
Go-version:       service/voltha/omci_mibs/go_templates
