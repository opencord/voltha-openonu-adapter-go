This probably also requires to have the last tid as parameter to that function (which should not be a bigger issue by using a new CC function GetOnuSwSecLastTid within omci_onu_upgrade).",

      "message": "Concerning print frame usage: This paramater setting has no effect anymore in your sequence of send functions. I\u0027d appreciate if you\u0027d really print the last (responseRequired) section if requested per parameter, but this can\u0027t be controlled here anymore (just) using the callback parameter. I think it would be good to pass the print option with the callbackPair set when reaching the last section. But based on that at sending (within deviceHandler?) I would avoid printing the whole window then, but really only the last section. If that is to complicated [and the way it works with this patch version] I\u0027d rather skip printing completely - and you can just skip setting the print option here (which is then more misleading than anything else).",
