So parameters aTimeout and rxChan could be just shifted more adequate to SendOnuSwSectionsWindowWithRxSupervision(), where their content could be better used for the single send request initialisation.\nMaybe also omciMsgsPerWindow is not needed here in case data can simply be written to OmciTransferStructure.txFrame\nMoreover: Any reason why you changed the return argument from pointer to direct structure?

      "message": "Two remarks here:\n1.) you allow prio config here (for the used TID numbers), while the real sending is later done only from the low priority queue. So either you enforce usage of low-prio TID\u0027s or you extend the code at sending also to use the high prio queue. Latest is maybe a bit oversized for this function here, as long as really only used for SwSection transfer. You could similarly remove the highprio parameter here and always just use the lowPrio TID\u0027s as well as sending later from the low prio queue\n2.) as already mention on patch #11: now here is the point, where TID\u0027s are fixed for the OMCI transmission. As stated there could be other parallel single-frame OMCI send requests that are directly sent (theoretically also low priority) - and the sequence of transmission in the TID might get broken. As stated before I think it would be required to hold an according semaphore as long as the frames are collected here, so that every other parallel send request has to wait for this transmission first",
