      "message": "Why is sleep not a good idea? It is the simplest solution, of course there are others. time.Sleep in go as far as I know should just block here, allowing concurrent threads to continue (and that is the intention of this code). So in my point of view it is just what I want here. Another solution would be to start a timer here (with the advantage of possibly cancelling that from outside) but the behavior would more or less be the same.",
