So you would copy theses values to downstream? I\u0027d guess this is not really needed here.",

      "message": "Also question for previously existing code: Looks a bit \u0027asymmetrical\u0027 compared to upstream handling. So here you don\u0027t expect anymore that downstream collection delivers receivedMask \u003d 0 (in which case you could abourt the downstream collection)? Is it not an option that ONU\u0027s may indicate downstream values as unsupported (at least theoretically)? So may be use the \u0027all-or nothing\u0027 scheme here, which might be acceptable. But perhaps you can make an according comment on that.",
