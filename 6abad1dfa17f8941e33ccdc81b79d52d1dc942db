      "message": "See comments below, looks all a bit complicated. Even though with this way or with small modifications it may work as well.\nI made a different proposal in slack, which might be a bit easier and re-usable also for other ME classes. But well, I am still not sure if that would be sufficient. Basically it would look like this: \nfunc (onuDeviceDB *onuDeviceDB) AllocateMeInstance(ctx context.Context, meClassID me.ClassID, allocatedAttributes me.AttributeValueMap) (uint16, bool, error){\n...//check existence of ME instance based on internal MeInstance counter MeInstUsed\n...//if MeInstUsed: MeInstUsed++, return Id, true, nil\n...//else meInstUsed++ (\u003d1), PutMe(..., meInstUsed) //to store usage to DB\n} //while I\u0027m still unsure if it would not be sufficient to pass max one meAttributeValueMap entry (with the pair of string and interface) - but maybe that is even more complicated.\nsimilar also this one:\nfunc (onuDeviceDB *onuDeviceDB) FreeMeInstance(ctx context.Context, meClassID me.ClassID, meInstId, me.InstID, allocatedAttributes me.AttributeValueMap) (error){ ...}\nand modification of existing functions to:\nfunc (onuDeviceDB *onuDeviceDB) PutMe(ctx context.Context, meClassID me.ClassID, meEntityID uint16, meAttributes me.AttributeValueMap, instanceUsage uint16 ) {...}\nfunc (onuDeviceDB *onuDeviceDB) GetMe(meClassID me.ClassID, meEntityID uint16) me.AttributeValueMap, instanceUsage uint16 {..}  (while here it coudl be discussed, if instanceUsage is really required - now just for symmetry.\nOf course that would mean that all existing calles to PutMe have to be changed to PutMe(..., 0)",

But attributeMap[0] could be anything from the ME attributeMap, e.g. \"\"Deprecated\":  1\".
