If it is a relaxed decode failure that is enabled, you keep on processing and have a log message knowing that some ONU may have an issue (or OMCI-LIB-GO needs to be updated to support a new attribute).\n\nIf line 336 also is successful, but it is a bad decode of the Message Type layer, then you also will have a bit more info of what OMCI-LIB-GO thought was bad.\n\nIf line 336 fails, you have a bit more info at the OMCI layer as well.",
