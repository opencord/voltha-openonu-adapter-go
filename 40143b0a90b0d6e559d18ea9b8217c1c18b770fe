      "message": "I would apply Holgers comments from patch set #1 also here, that the port state change should only be generated in case the ports have really been deactivated on the ONU.\nAs discussed in patch set #1 comments I would propose to accept this solution here as temporary improvement and update the code later to a more consistent handling.",

      "message": "Hmm, that\u0027s some kind of view on that. But the problem with that is, that nobody could really judge for sure then, if the physical connection to the ONU is still there or not. The ONU could be unplugged without any further notification from this state here. So my interpretation of the connection status would be more an indication about if the ONU can be reached on OMCI or not (in my point of view the only thing the ONU adapter can really deliver as connection state). But well, if the VOLTHA state definition shall better be as given in this change, I can also live with that.",

      "message": "you mean that the ONU will stay in the Disabled state forever if the cable gets unplugged ? I think that is fine. What we need to make sure is that when the operator re-enables it we fail because we can\u0027t reach it and put the status to unreachable. I can open a jira for that.",

      "message": "To be more precise on what I meant: I assumed this way the ONU will stay in ConnectionStatus \u0027reachable\u0027 independent from any layer 1 status of the ONU connection because it does not know anything about that directly. But of course there is the OLT adapter \u0027ONU indication\u0027 interface to the onu adapter, which might still correctly update the ONU layer 1 state also for the ONU adapter. So that way the delivered ONU conncetion status will only rely on this \u0027ONU indication\u0027 information - if this is the desired behavior I\u0027m fine with it.\nI would not expect problems with the OperState, so I don\u0027t think some Jira s required for that.",
