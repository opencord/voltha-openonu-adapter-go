      "message": "First it is checked, whether there is a corresponding map-entry at all for this ONU-type generated during a previous ONU-startup. If so, and its value is \"true\", we know that something happened (e.g. manually deleted or modified) with the mib-template in KV-store after it was successfully generated by this previous ONU-startup. The flag will be set to false than, what triggers a new mib-template-creation attempt after mib-upload cycle of the current ONU-startup.",

      "message": "\"exists\" only indicates the existence of a map-element for the current ONU-type at all. It means, that there was a previous attempt to create a mib-template by another ONU of the same type. The value of this map-element indicates whether this creation attempt was sussessful or not. But I see your point - it would also be possible to take the information whether the corresponding map-element itself exists or not as differentiator. But I would like to leave it as it is, as the map in its current form stores the information, whether there was a mib-template generation attempt for a particular ONU-type at all and whether it was successful or not. This information could potentially be useful for debugging.",
