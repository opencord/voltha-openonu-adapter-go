If so, and its value is \"true\", we know that something happened (e.g. manually deleted or modified) with the mib-template in KV-store after it was successfully generated by this previous ONU-startup. The flag will be set to false than, what triggers a new mib-template-creation attempt after mib-upload cycle of the current ONU-startup.",
