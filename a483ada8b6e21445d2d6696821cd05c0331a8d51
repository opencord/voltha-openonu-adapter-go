You could consider to use it, but perhaps you decided already willingly against that?",

Otherwise there is a danger of not requesting the expected interval anymore (Seems like the request is not smply delayed here but omitted at all if in another state). DataRequest or ConfigAdd/Delete should have no (nearly no) influence on the Pm request sequence.",
