      "message": "I\u0027m unsure what this error means, it\u0027s in a few places and I\u0027d like to understand better. Does it yield the fact that you can\u0027t store the tech profile to ETCD ? if this is the case I think it\u0027s ok not having this as error, because even slower, the system could still function with no issues by during the full expanse with the ONU, no ? if that is the case a warn should probably be enough, or even info. \nin any case I\u0027d have a message like Failed to setup techProfileKVStore -- can\u0027t write tech profile to etcd",

      "message": "At this point the error indicates, that the system is not able to setup the backend connection between the adapter and the etcd for the access to the techProfile store. Such should hopefully not appear and if so, then it would mean that the adapter can\u0027t read the tech profiles. This in turn means, that the ONU data path can\u0027t be configured. Hence in my point of view it would be a quite important error (as already stated for other points, a more sophisticated error treatment could/should be implemented later, e.g. also trying to make such events visible to ONOS by some autonomous problem report - which would probably require overall system extensions in the core and ONOS itsef ...).\nFor now I would recommend to leave the treatment as it is. Concerning the log statement - if you like my proposal would then be to use \"Can\u0027t access techProfileKVStore - no backend connection to etcd service/voltha/technology_profiles\"",
