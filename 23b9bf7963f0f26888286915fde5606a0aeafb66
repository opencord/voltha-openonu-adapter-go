      "message": "Yes VERSION/wildcard tag checking is normally performed every job.\n\nThis job is strange (see comments \u0026 history, need to research).  The rebase-with-master job ran successfully so either we had:\n  o A timing problem -- not likely, last merge 2 weeks ago\n  o Pipeline tag check did not run for some reason.\n\nIn any event, opening a jira ticket for this behavior.\n\n\nOddity #2\n---------\n  This failed job URL was sent as email status but is not reflected in the history.  Was the pipeline stage re-run , succeeded and 2nd status masked the underlying failure condition (?)\n\nhttps://jenkins.opencord.org/job/version-tag_wildcard/490/console\n\n\nOddity #3\n---------\n  Patch was reverted (click on revert link in gerrit, top right).  Apply was displayed as status for a time in gerrit.  After revert job passed status reverted to \u0027merged\u0027 which seems to have merged the patch out of existence (cannot apply changes to a patch in the merged state).",
